# SqlCleaner

This is a Windows Forms tool that converts 'sp_prepexec' queries into executable SQL Server queries. 'sp_prepexec' queries are generated by SQL Server Profiler when analyzing parameterized queries executed from JDBC applications and are usually not executable in SSMS or other clients without modification.

The tool leverages DacFX to accomplish the conversion and provides a more reliable solution than using regular expressions.
